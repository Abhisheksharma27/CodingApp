#Coding Application

In this part we have moved further ahead in the application.

We have added authentication as our main home page and user can only operate the application if he/she has logged in the app.

After that we have the front page which navigates to various fetaures of the app.
The list has been populated using adapter as a bridge between data source and UI.

The languages tab show the languages menu where you can navigate to different languages and they further have their own options inside.
We have still not added any info regarding the languages but would be adding them in the next version of the application.

The doubts section uses the firebase firestore utility. You can submit the doubt in this text box by selecting language and the doubt goes in the databse. You can see all the doubts ever asked in the query. We would be working on the feature to add answers staright in the app for review instead of sending personal emails as the solutions.

Join us would ask for a file of type txt or .pdf . This part will also work in the next version
